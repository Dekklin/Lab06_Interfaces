# Interface Project
This program's sole purpose is to practice with the implementation of interfaces by building a Zoo full of animals. We create a tree of classes representing different kinds of animals. Different branche gain a variety of Methods and Properties through inheritence.

# Definitions
### Encapsulation
When a group of similar properties and methods are treated as a package. You can give bundle properties and methods and attatch them to objects all at once.
### Inheritence
When a class and it's preceding classes inherit similar methods and properies. Almost like the family tree of the animal kingdom.
### Polymorphism
The ability to change the outcome or the behavior of a method or property independantly from all the other inherited classes. Not all birds fly. Not all creatures in the water that swim are fish.
